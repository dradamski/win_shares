# win_shares
This purpose of this project is to explore the relationships between a player's win shares and team success. Win shares is an interesting
stat to me because it is heavily influenced by team success, but there is potential for exceptional individual seasons to transcend this 
inherent relationship. Players like Anthony Davis are on consistently weak teams, yet continue to appear on league leader lists at the end
of the year.

Questions:
1.  Player Win Shares vs. Team Wins
2.  Individual Win Total Max and Min: An example would be to look at all win share leaders who's team won 48 games and see what players
    contributed the most to that total.
3.  Most appearences on the Win Share leaderboard
4.  Is it possible to predict a player's team wins based off their win shares? What tools would I need to answer this question?
5.  Who was the greatest over performer in win shares? Win Shares / Team Wins
6.  Once I have explored the data and identified trends, I can look at the seasons from a more qualitative perspective. What season storylines
    were at play during the season? Were there obvious All Star or All NBA snubs? Were there obvious "legacy" picks to the detriment of 
    smaller name players?
